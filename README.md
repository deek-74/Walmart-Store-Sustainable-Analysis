♻️ LoopCart: Return Decision Predictor
This project is designed to streamline the return management system for Walmart and similar large-scale retail chains. It intelligently classifies returned products into Recycle, Donate, or Resell categories 
based on key parameters such as Condition Score, Product Value, and Usage Days.

A user-friendly Streamlit application has been developed to predict return decisions in real time (snapshot included). Additionally, a comprehensive Power BI dashboard has been created to visualize inventory
performance, product returns, IoT efficiency, and perishable waste analytics. Snapshots of both tools are attached for reference.
